```

**Example for development:**
```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://10.55.13.5:5000
```

**Example for production:**
```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
```

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** React Native with Expo
- **Navigation:** Expo Router (file-based routing)
- **State Management:** React Context API
- **Styling:** React Native StyleSheet
- **Icons:** Expo Vector Icons
- **HTTP Client:** Fetch API
- **Storage:** AsyncStorage for local data persistence

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
